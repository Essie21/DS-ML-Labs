## Python Data Structures: Lists, Tuples & Dictionaries


## 🎯 Objectives

1. Understand and implement various types of operators in Python
2. Master arithmetic operations and their applications
3. Learn comparison operators for boolean evaluations
4. Implement logical operators for complex condition handling
5. Explore bitwise operations at the binary level



## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Anaconda Navigator**



## 📋 Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Set Up Environmeent

- Opened Jupyter Notebook in my IDE
- Ensured Python 3.x is installed
- Created a new notebook file for Assignment 2


#### Step 2: Implement Arithmetic Operators (with x=20, y=4)

- Addition (+) operation  resulting in 24
- Subtraction (-) operation resulting in 16
- Multiplication (*) using asterisk notation resulting in 80
- Division (/) with forward slash resulting in 5.0
- Floor Division (//) to get whole numbers without decimals
- Modulo (%) operation to find remainders
- Exponential (**) using double asterisks for power calculations


#### Step 3: Apply Comparison Operators

- Greater than (>) comparison operations
- Less than (<) comparison operations
- Equal to (==) checking value equality
- Greater than or equal to (>=) compound comparisons
- Less than or equal to (<=) range checking
- Not Equal to (!=) inequality verification
- Observed Boolean outputs (True / False)


#### Step 4: Master Logical Operators

- AND operator (both conditions must be true)
- OR operator (at least one condition must be true)
- NOT operator (negates the condition set)


#### Step 5: Practice Assignment Operators

- Simple assignment (=) to assign values
- Addition assignment (+=) to add and assign
- Subtraction assignment (-=) to subtract and assign
- Multiplication assignment (*=) to multiply and assign
- Division assignment (/=) for division results
- Floor division assignment (//=) for whole number division
- Exponentiation assignment (**=) for power operations


#### Step 6: Explore Bitwise Operations

- AND (&) operator for binary AND operations
- OR (|) operator for binary OR operations
- Exclusive OR (^) for XOR calculations
- NOT (~) operator to negate binary digits
- Left Shift (<<) to shift bits left and multiply by 2^n
- Right Shift (>>) to shift bits right and divide by 2^n
- Converted between decimal and binary representations



## 💻 Commands Executed
```
#### Arithmetic Operators
- x = 20, y = 4
- print(x + y)  # 24
- print(x - y)  # 16
- print(x * y)  # 80
- print(x / y)  # 5.0
- print(x // y)  # 5
- print(x % y)  # 0 (remainder)
- x = 5, y = 3
- print(x ** y)  # 125

#### Comparison Operators
- x = 54, y = 77
- print(x > y)  # False
- print(x < y)  # True
- print(x == y)  # False
- print(x >= y)  # False
- print(x <= y)  # True
- print(x != y)  # True

#### Logical Operators
- x = 32, y = 21
- print(x > 30 and y < 25)  # True
- not (x < 32)  # True (negates false to true)

#### Assignment Operators
- x = 55  # Assign 55
- x += 78  # Adds 78, result 133
- x -= 23  # Subtracts 23
- x *= 3  # Multiplies by 3, result 30
- x /= 2  # Divides by 2, result 5.0
- x //= 3  # Floor divides, result 3
- x **= 3  # Exponentiates, result 8

#### Bitwise Operators
- x = 55 (Binary: 00110111)
- y = 70 (Binary: 01000110)

AND (&): x & y = 6 (Binary: 00000110)
OR (|): x | y = 119 (Binary: 01110111)
XOR (^): x ^ y = 113 (Binary: 01110001)
NOT (~): ~55 = -56 (Binary: 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0)
LEFT SHIFT (<<): 55 << 2 = 220 (Add 2 zeros on right)
RIGHT SHIFT (>>): 55 >> 2 = 13 (Remove last 2 digits)
